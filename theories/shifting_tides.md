# The Shifting Tides of Programming

To start this entry we will begin with a little of background

## The background of programming before the 2010-2021(year of writing) range
Back in these days programming was a lot more lucrative than it is now.

Programming jobs have become less valuable over the years as new languages and protocols for simplifying the hard tasks done by the old programmers were made simple

This is where the shifting tides occur.

### Education in Programming

As years progress we have actually started to see Programming and general computer classes in schools.

But all curriculum taught in these classes are really dry and never enough to even barely give kids a start.

Examples are that of High School AP CSP and AP CSA classes.

After personally taking these classes I realized that our education in Computer programming really isn't all that caught up.

Even in AP CSA the last AP computer science class you take I have felt no challenges in it.

And heroes where the tides really begin to shift.

### The effects of a generation raised on video games

My theory on my generation which was mostly raised on video games is that we have developed a new brain norm.

This new brain norm is that of a prediction and solution mindset.

Video Games usually required one of those two traits to really be there and develop.

Like puzzle games and racing really required solution mindsets to find solutions for puzzles and or problems during races.

Games like fps and such were really based on prediction mindsets precipitating every angle at which someone might come and using your senses to confirm your guesses.

Now as far as I can tell the prediction based mindsets that were facilitated by the video games in this generation is more prevalent to programming than the solution mindset.

As being able to predict really well in program allows for a lot. Predicting run outputs, finding errors and algorithmic thinking.

Now with this said how does this cause a shift in tide.

#### The Shift

With all my past said evidence of the gaming generation I can effectively prove why education in programming is going to fail and shift.

And why old languages like Java and C++ will soon become obsolete

As more kids with the gaming mindsets move into the highschool age group they start to realize the great gifts they have been given for the time spent as kids.

As for me, it happened in the summer of eight grade. The story starts like this: I wanted to make a minecraft server for me and my friends on ps4, and so I found a server software for mcpe.

First off I found a PHP Server Software called PMMP, and from there I started to program plugins and try to understand it.

And that's when I learned of my amplitude in programming and why I skyrocketed ahead of most other plugin programmers in just four months.

As far as I can tell I'm probably not the only kid who is going to experience or has experienced this, and it will probably continue to dish out this way.

As the normality of programming education now has to be edited to include the traits and base amplitude of newer generations as we become more bonded with tech.

Of course this shift hasn't progressed much, but in the near future is when it will really become visible as more kids start programming early with the right traits.

Those that have the traits and have the most time to have experience are those that will lead the upcoming changes to technology as we know it.
