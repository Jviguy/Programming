# Skill in programming

So to start this entry off we are going to be talking about the illusion of skill in programming.

For me when I see some code or a program when I say "Wow! this must be made by a really good programmer." which rarely ever happens anymore after realizing this entry.

but when it used to happen It's when I saw really advanced looking code which looked really cool and or complicated. And this theory is definitely somewhere out their on psychology.net (satire), but I feel that in programming its even more important than most fields.

## Reason one
The first reason I believe this theory is more prevalent in programming than any other fields is because of the illusion of skill.

### The Skill Illusion
To me a programmer has no skill as programming isn't something you really work your hands on or build muscle for. Programming is all about memorization meaning the better memory you have in programming the more *skillful* at programming you might be.

A prime example is the difference between a beginner in a certain language and an experience programmer who has been using it for four years.

Now from here this theory gets a bit difficult to prove as this dives pretty deep into the neuroscience and randomness of humans.

Out of chance that the beginner has better memorization over long periods of time no matter what this programming will be classified as less skillful than the experienced programmer.

Now give the both of them around maybe 2 - 3 years to improve and what not. The one with more experience will probably not grow in `skill` as he has already learned all the given tricks and information before.

But the beginner now is considered more skilled than before and probably on par to the experienced programmer.

Which in this case proves my illusion `is there really skill in programming?`. Did the beginner just gain skill in programming or did he always have that skill because of his memorization.

Now of course this proof isn't perfect as it ignores a lot of what counteracts the claim. Like well what is `skill` is it just the level of memorization of doing some task. Or does it refer to the amplitude that you have in a certain task.

Which brings in a second proof.

Two beginners decide to pick a new language and for this example we will use PHP.

One beginner skyrockets in his programming knowledge within months while the other beginner has to spend years just to perfect one language fluently.

Who is really more skillful at programming in php the one who gained more knowledge in months or the one with experience and is fluent.

Is skill in programming really just memorization or experience?

Now we could really just argue back and forth on this forever, but as for me, I believe skill in programming is experience.

And for me the reason is that experience is gained in any task and yes while it does refer to gaining amplitude in a task over time.

A person who may memorize better and faster could reach the same amount of intellect in the given programming languages in a shorter amount of time than the experienced one.

And for me that leads to me believing that programming isn't really a game of skill, but rather of talent and amplitude. Does the faster the start you had mean your more skillful or does skill cap out.

So once you have learnt a language to its max does this mean that you can't have more skill in it than someone who can learn faster than you?

No it doesn't, what happens is that yes the person may know of the existence of the given things you do, but there's a difference in usage.

A more experience programmer in a language might use the given knowledge and functions for the best place / usage.

But a programmer who just understands them might use them at a place where it might be better to use a `Arc` rather than a `Mutex` so on so forth.

Memory is gained with experience, correct usage and behaviours are only gained with experience. No matter how fast you might learn if you don't have the same amount of experience as another programming you will never be more `skilled` than them.

#### tl;dr

Skill in programming is really just experience as memory can never provide that which experience does.

### The impact of the skill illusion

The illusion of skill in programming may actually be causing more issues than you could imagine.

Skill in programming as said before is really just experience, but is perceived as an actual bundle of knowledge by beginners usually.

What this does are discouraging people from even starting in programming. When you see some really confusing code that looks advanced what do you first say. 

For me that's `Oh fuck man I don't want to learn all this shit`. Tbh it's not that bad of a response as who want to learn C++ based off of `windows.h`.

Which really goes to show that major impact is that no beginner wrote `windows.h` and no beginner probably wrote any of the code you have actually read yet.

Which this explains why coding schools like `Code Ninjas` and coding classes in schools work really well for beginning levels of programming.

For more information on school lessons of programming and what not check out `theories/shifiting_tides.md`

But how that prevails to this theory is that the kids are never shown advanced level code.

And this gets into my next theory on skill in programming.

#### The Programming Shark / The ProgramKing Tendency

This is a study on a very basic and generic tendency of humans in general and appears in programming and most fields.

This tendency is described as taking over a room / place because you feel that you are the best at some skill / task.

And this very well happens in programming, in the usual programming classroom there will form a hierarchy of `skill`.

Usually it will be like:

1. The smartest kid in the class
2. The teacher
3. The second-smartest kid

This forms like this because most teachers that teach programming classes aren't there to teach programming and were probably never good at it.

Most of them were business teachers who were forced to teach programming classes as it's the closest field to programming.

Which is another issues described in `theories/shifiting_tides.md`

But what this causes in the classroom is a depravity for the other students

As most kids will never think they can reach where the smart kid is and be better

But the previous proofs for the skill illusion show perfectly well that all it takes is time.

Sure you might not be better than that person at all the things he does, but you can be much better than them at one.

Which is what companies are really looking to hire. Not someone who does everything mediocre and is a Programming Shark, but someone with a specialization in one specific need of the company.

### Another impact of the skill illusion.
Female programmers that make it Programming Two class are very scarce. In my class there was only 9 people in total and there was 1 female. Keep in mind this was a school year with 5000 people enrolled.

So what's really causing this drop in numbers as most Programming 1 and Fundamentals of Computing classes get like 20 - 30 people.

So is it just bad classes or is it the intimidation of programming or is it the false image of programming.

The false image is described in `theories/image.md` describing what the Jobs of programming and computers are seen as by students and workers.

## Resolution

Now with all that said how do we fix this `issue`

Really one way is to not call people good at programming is to rather say they are experienced at that given language.

Another is to keep everyone in a class at equal levels.

As explained in `theories/shifiting_tides.md` most school classes for programming keep people in the same class no matter if they already have more experience than the class needs.

This shouldn't be done like this programming is a really new field, so I can understand a few issues, but this is a big issue which is restricting the amount of people that may be interested in it.

School courses keep these Programming Sharks in a beginner level class, and they just go around fixing kids code and running their opportunity to learn and experience it on their own.

Which is why `theories/beginnings.md` explains that you should learn on your own.

There is less discouragement and makes it easier to learn and not have everything tested on you in a wide field like programming.
